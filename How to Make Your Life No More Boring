Nothing makes me more afraid of than a boring life. So I never allow my life to become dull and repeated. You needn’t 
bother asking me the secret. I’m just about to share it with you.
Meet New Challenges
When you’re well adjusted to your daily work, it will become a routine which is the very root of a boring life. Why not 
creat some new challenges for yourself? Try to achive another goal on your job, work harder, develop a new project or 
walk toward a brand new horizon.
Office Tips
When you really get tired of things at hand, it’s more helpful to give yourself a change than continue your work 
unefficiently. When my eyes are heavy because of staring at the computer for a long time, I would rather take a few 
minutes to tidy up my desk. I like my profiles in order. Everything neat and clean keeps me in good mood.
Maybe you can’t accept a monotone version. Give a feast for your eyes by choosing a new desktop background. Let the fresh
picture take you to a splendid scenery.
After a long sitting, doing some stretches loosens you up. Shaking, twisting or a few sit-ups help get rid of sleepiness.

Drink more water. Lack of water slows down your blood circulation, while enough water accelerates it. Are you beginning 
to doze off? Let water wake you up.
Come some music. Your favorite music makes you relax and add fun to your job. Use an earphone in case of disturbing 
others.
Sleep for a short while. Your boss may balk, but a new study shows that getting some midday shut-eye could be 
heart-healthy. 
All the above are good for you to get through the time when you’re bored with the office life.
Life Becomes Colorful with Hobbies
Some people who are devoted to work often feel at a loss on the weekends because they don’t know how to spend those 
pastimes. One solution is to develop some hobbies. Reading and writing is the best way for me to spend my leisure time.
Recently I’m reading Uncle Tom’s Cabin which describes a story of a Negro slave. Through the destiny of Tom, I learned 
the history of that time. What I’m reading are not words but knoledge. Then I would write down my perception and 
comprehension about the book, or about life. 
Or learn a useful skill in your spare time. Computer programming, Adobe InDesign, writing, painting, reparing and so on,
choose one that you like to improve yourself.
I fall in love with online shopping recently. I’m fed up with the big crowd in stores and markets. For me, online 
shopping is a fresh way of consumption I seldom tried before, especially those coupon sites which helps save money. I 
bought sweater and jeans on www.PromoDigg.com. It unexpectedly saves me $20!
Other Sparkles of Idea
Enjoy walking. It’s an easy way to keep healthy and enjoy life. Take a walk in your neighborhood or drive to the suburb.
Notice what have been ignored at ordinary times. Appreciate the peaceful environment and beautiful scenery around. Give 
a thought to your dreams, your plans, your days and your dear ones.
Have one or two days off. Sometimes when we’re trapped in a mass of work, struggling to move but still at a standstill, 
jumping out to catch a breath will be better. All you need is to have a good rest, recharge yourself, organize your 
thoughts, and start out again.
Write a letter to your lover or spouse in email or on paper. Tell him or her your love and care. This must be a surprise
which adds color to your life and gives the relationship a boost.
Maybe your life has been too quiet and needs some ripples. Do something crazy to stimulate your nerves. Sing in your full
voice, dance to your extrem, go barefoot anywhere you want … But keep one thing in mind---be careful not to hurt yourself!
